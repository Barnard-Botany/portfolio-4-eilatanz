## Review: mapping data from BIEN

```{r}
#Just to review, let's recall how we can download data from BIEN
#We'll do that for several species in a genus from Latin America, Jungia 
#We can get occurrence data and also species range models

J_paniculata <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia paniculata")
J_pauciflora <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia pauciflora")
J_polita <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Jungia polita")

J_paniculata_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia paniculata")
J_pauciflora_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia pauciflora")
J_polita_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia polita")

# Both can be mapped, for example: 
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35), ylim=c(-40,12))
  plot(J_pauciflora_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
```

```{r}
# Map another Jungia species
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
plot(J_polita_rangemap, col="red", add=T)
```

```{r}
# And a third Jungia
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
plot(J_paniculata_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
```

```{r}
# Map occurence records for three species of Jungia
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
points(cbind(J_pauciflora$longitude, J_pauciflora$latitude), col="red", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(J_paniculata$longitude, J_paniculata$latitude), col="blue", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(J_polita$longitude, J_polita$latitude), col="green", pch=20, cex=.8)
```

## Combining occurrence data and climate data

Mapping occurrence data is informative for discerning species ranges overlap. But could we add  more information, such as how each species overlaps with climate variables?. 

Of course we can, by tapping into the worldclim data base: http://www.worldclim.org/

Peruse their on-line resource, where it's possible to obtain data for past and future climate based on various climate models.

There are a lot of details here, but important to know that the temperature data are in degrees C times 10. The unit for precipitation data is millimeters, and for altitude is meters. 

#shows us whole world, though we don't "need" the whole world: 

```{r}
all.worldclim <- raster::getData("worldclim", res = 10, var = "bio")
all.worldalt <- raster::getData("worldclim", res = 10, var = "alt")
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]])
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]])
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]])
```

Climate data can be combined with occurrence data downloaded from BIEN, or any geo-coded data.

Below are three examples:
first with a temperature variable
next with a precipitation variable
lastly with topographic elevation as the variable ("altitude")

```{r}
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 24, cex = 0.5)
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]])
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]])
points(J_polita[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")

```

#altitute data, limited in longtue and y axis is long 40:00 in recording
#temps will go from 0 to 400 (which is weird but it's because temp is taken in celcius and the meters are actually what is on the right side - they take percipitation in cm so are in thousands, and then temps are in 100s with celcius so 0 is freezing, but multiply it by ten to make the data more available to do it times ten instead of using decimal places. so 30.3 c is 303 c, white is the ocean. The below is Iberia with the pyranese mountains. surrounded by water and mountains. examples of endemism in spain also even though not an island, and insects and plants)

```{r}
#To change the spatial extent (i.e. "zoom in"), re-set limits with "xlim" and "ylim" 
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]], xlim=c(-10,4),ylim=c(35,45))
```


```{r}
#Or try the command "crop" with an argument to "extent" #bio1 shows temperature
#four numbers are required: the xlim numbers first (west and east longitude)
#followed by the ylim numbers next (south and north latitude)
peninsula.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-10, 4, 35, 45))
plot(peninsula.worldclim[["bio1"]])
#You can get latitudes and longitudes from mP, whether a published paper map or Google maps. 
```

Answer the questions about this peninsula example. Then do your own example from Latin America:

Answer the questions about this peninsula example. Then do your own example from Latin America:
#1. Where in the world is the peninsula mapped above?

Answer: It's the Iberian Peninsula, in Europe. Portugal (don't forget Portugal!) and Spain!

#2. Is altitude a climate variable? How do the peninsula maps plotted above support your answer?

Answer: The color gradient in the second map shows the climate across the peninsula as variable, and it would be unlikely this would occur without a change in altitude, but also when looking at it along with the first (altitude) map, the highest altitude areas are also the lowest temperature, showing that altitude effects climate and does become a climate variable.

J_polita_rangemap <- BIEN_ranges_load_species("Jungia polita")
```

```{r}
#basic south america map with occurance data

map('world', fill=T, col="white", bg="dark blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))

points(cbind(J_polita$longitude, J_polita$latitude), col="orange", pch=20, cex=.8)
```


#a. Crop the map to allow discerning more detail in the two ranges 
```{r}
southamerica.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-85, -35, -40, 12))
plot(southamer.worldclim[["bio1"]])

plot(southamerica.worldalt[["alt"]])
points(J_pauciflora[,c("longitude", "latitude")], col="blue", pch = 23, cex = 0.6)

```


## More occurrence data

BIEN is not the only database for getting species occurrence data. We've used it because it has already been thoroughly filtered to ensure that it uses correct species names, which it does by using (in the background) an R package called "taxize" that you can install and load and use. 

We're going to explore "taxize" a bit, then use the specific tool "rgbif" and then "spocc"

IMPORTANT: Many of the functions in "taxize" are interactive, and you often will need to interact through the console window (below) rather than work completely in this Notebook. That's true for the example below:



```{r}
library("rgbif")
library("spocc")
library("taxize")
#Sometimes you know the species name, but you may be a little unsure of the spelling 
results=gnr_resolve(names="Heirochloe odorata")
head(results$matched_name)
results=gnr_resolve(names="Solanum pimpinelifolia")
head(results$matched_name)
results=gnr_resolve(names="Sequoiadendron gigantium")
head(results$matched_name)
```


```{r}
#Now that we have the correct spelling, 
#Another thing to check is whether the name is accepted, or perhaps a synonym
#Believe it or not, scientific names for organisms have corresponding serial numbers
#These are called taxonomic serial numbers, and you can look them up with taxize
#which, in turn, interfaces something called the Integrated Taxonomic Information System 
#https://www.itis.gov/pdf/faq_itis_tsn.pdf
#The query is interactive, so look in the console and choose the taxon of interest

#asks for taxonomic serial number! Controversial common idea that plants should not have names, but have barcodes, since names are culturally biased and easy to get wrong
#if you publish ever, get your own orchid ID number to associate with yourself - each genus, species, order all given toxonomic serial number Integrative taxonomic information system 
#this will want input from you if there are more than one serial number for what we put in 

#says not accepted so we can choose any of them, chose 1 in class - it will show you the ACCEPTED name, different from what we had used before for sweetgrass name


name="Hierochloe odorata"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn
#The output suggests checking the itis database for the accepted name
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```

```{r}
#Another potentally useful tasks include looking for higher level taxonomy
#In other words, how can you tell if a scientific name of a plant is an angiosperm?
#How can you find out what family it belongs to?
#A variety of tools are useful and you can look at one species, or multiple.
#The example below looks at two species. 
#Potentially you could read in a dataframe from elsewhere (csv file, for example).
#And you could submit the variable species names are stored
classification(c("Metasequoia glyptostroboides", "Sequoiadendron giganteum"), db="itis")
```

```{r}
#Here's another way to do that, in another database 
#API key is a lot like a login and password key, so we're using some aspect of this to access - some info is not available so land developers can't eliminate endangered species to avoid conflict, etc
tax_name(q=" ", get="family", db="ncbi")
```

```{r}
#If you know a family but wanted to know all the genera in a family, or all species in a genus, 
#then you're referring to taxa "downstream"
downstream("Cupressaceae", downto="species", db="itis")
```

```{r}
#if you just want exactly one taxonomic rank lower, then this is referred to as "children"
#Here, because Catalogue of Life can and will be queried INTERACTIVELY, 
#new database is col
#you need to look at the console to choose the correct taxon of interest
#INTERACTIVE feature will require you to go to the console to scroll and select suggestions
children("Solanum", db="col")
```

```{r}
#Other useful name-related functions in gbif:

#look up names, looks up names connected to id number and looks up ___1:20:01 in recording
name_lookup(q="Hierochloe odorata")
name_backbone(name="Metasequoia glyptostroboides")
name_usage(5937158)
```

## Querying the GBIF database

To obtain data throught the GBIF database, taxonomy is important, and you might want to work with the package "taxize" before starting, but GBIF also has a lot of its own utilities for taxonomy built into an R package called "rgbif"

And, beyond rgbif, there are other database-specific packages like "rebird" for the Citizen Science app and database E-bird and "rinat" for working with I-Naturalist. 

These were created by a project called R-OpenSci, which also has a package called "spocc" that can query multiple databases at the same time. 

And, generally, data from such databases needs to be "cleaned" in a number of ways, for which you will need a package called "scrubr". These packages for digital natural history and biodiversity science were created and are maintained by Scott Chamberlain, who works for R-OpenSci.


Let's first focus just on one of the more comprehensive databases, GBIF. 

```{r}
library(rgbif)
#We are going to do a few things here
#First, if you look in the RGBIF documentation, you can find all the values that can be included with the argument "RecordTypes" -- I put them into a vector with the command below:
#(she looked up in gbif what all the different types - machines would be phones, camera traps, microphones)

RecordTypes <- c('HUMAN_OBSERVATION', 'FOSSIL_SPECIMEN', 'LITERATURE', 'LIVING_SPECIMEN', 'MACHINE_OBSERVATION', 'OBSERVATION', 'PRESERVED_SPECIMEN', 'UNKNOWN')
RecordTypes

#There are other things you can do, like looking for records from a given year, which could obviously be combined with Record Types. 

#You see that we have eight types of records. 
#Now, we could look at all eight of these one by one using this command
obs <- occ_count(basisOfRecord = 'HUMAN_OBSERVATION')
obs

```



```{r}
#Or, we could use a for loop, which will re-iterate the same command over and over again but each time changing the input to the command.

#In R, loops starts with an open bracket sign, 
#Then, the command must define where to find the values in each iteration of the loop
#An example loop is in the chunk below, using the vector RecordTypes, defined above
#read it in and try to do it digitally as a loop below

#Look up and get counts for each record type, gievs a scope of what is in rgbif since it's huge and they are dated
for (i in RecordTypes) {
type=i
obs <- occ_count(basisOfRecord = i)
print(c(type, obs))
}
```




Here's another example of a loop, counting records from different years. 

What does the output tell us about dates in the GBIF database?  

```{r}
#Here are all the years I want to look up 
#in a vector
Years <- c("1599", "1600", "1601", "1619", "1659", "1699", "1700", "1701", "1719", "1759", "1799", "1800", "1801", "1809", "1819", "1829", "1839", "1849", "1859", "1869", "1879", "1889", "1899", "1900", "1903", "1953", "2000", "2003", "2017", "2018")
#Here, I'm making an empty vector for all the occurrence counts that I get out of - an empty place to be filled with observation counts for all those years put in
obs <- NULL
#Now, starting a "for loop" to query  GBIF to count  occurrences in each of the years

#when you see weird numbers at the turn of centuries, it may be they did not have accurate data and so just did the decade's ought number

for (i in Years) {
obs[i] <- occ_count(year=i)
}
#loop is finished
obs
#This gives output awkwardly, as  two vectors, reading across two rows
(obs <- as.data.frame(obs))
#This gives output in a better format: dataframe puts years in a left-most column as Row Names, and then in the next column each cell as occurrence counts for each year, reading down.
```


Let's go back to our peninsula, which is a hotspot of endemism for many plant and animal species. Remember to load the R Package "rgbif".

```{r}
library(rgbif)
Spergularia <- occ_search(scientificName="Spergularia melanocaulos", limit=1000)
#head(Spergularia)
colnames(Spergularia$data)
#Spergularia$data$genus
#Spergularia$data$species
#unique limits biases - just give everythign that's there at one row in the dataset
#if you do it the same with the genus it will give you a list of all of the species in that genus

unique(Spergularia$data$genus)
unique(Spergularia$data$species)
```


Very good habit to trim the default data downloaded to be smaller, and make sure it's a data frame. Also make sure you have only complete cases because some of the code below will choke if there are missing values. Also, sometimes the same individual plant/population will be recorded at multiples times in the same location, which is why you may want to run the "unique" commands. The "dim" command helps you look at how you trimmed down the file.


```{r}
#$ says what kind of thing which is indicated after - name you gave it goes before
#Choose just three variables
Spergularia.small <- subset(Spergularia$data, select=c("species", "decimalLatitude",
"decimalLongitude"))
#Rename the columns, make sure you're working with a dataframe
colnames(Spergularia.small) <- c("species", "lat", "lon")
Spergularia.small <- as.data.frame(Spergularia.small)
head(Spergularia.small)
tail(Spergularia.small)
#There are often occurrences with missing values to remove to trim it down so R knows what to do with it and doesn't have NA data
dim(Spergularia.small)
Spergularia.small <- Spergularia.small[complete.cases(Spergularia.small),]
dim(Spergularia.small)
#Also there may be duplicates, the same plant or population observed twice
#Or uploaded twice into the database
Spergularia.u <- unique(Spergularia.small)
dim(Spergularia.u)
```



#Working instead with the package "spocc"

This package is great for working with GBIF or other databases. 

```{r}
#We can look up a species (occ is occurance for spocc commands) limit is how many records to get 
DawnRedwood <- occ(q="Metasequoia glyptostroboides", from="gbif", limit=50)
DawnRedwood
#By default spocc will return a sample of just 500 observations
#Here, to speed things up during class, I've further limited to just 50 records
#Even though we can see there are 1688 occurrences in the database
#Also, looking in "Environment" in the upper right, we can see that 
#this is not a dataframe. It is a new type of object "Large occdat" which has 10 elements
#One of those elements is data
#We can ask for at data using this format - rename it and look at it (get the heading) 
DawnRedwood.dat <- (DawnRedwood$gbif$data)
head(DawnRedwood.dat)
#But that gives ALL the fields. 
#A nifty function called occ2df gives just some essential data
#It's nifty that the package "spocc" converts this huge result into a slimmed down dataframe (no more extra data in there)
DawnRedwood.df <- occ2df(DawnRedwood)
DawnRedwood.df
#You can see that there are some occurrence records that lack longitude and latitude
#Then you can exclude them
dim(DawnRedwood.df)
DawnRedwood.df <- DawnRedwood.df[complete.cases(DawnRedwood.df),]
dim(DawnRedwood.df)
DawnRedwood.df
#You should see that six of our 50 lines were left out
```

```{r}
#Check out idigbio 
# topull from there will be less data because it's only using digital scans
GiantRedwood.digbio <- occ(q="Sequoia giganteum", from="idigbio", limit=50)
GiantRedwood.digbio <- occ2df(GiantRedwood.digbio)
GiantRedwood.digbio
GiantRedwood.digbio <- GiantRedwood.digbio[complete.cases(GiantRedwood.digbio),]
dim(GiantRedwood.digbio)
GiantRedwood.digbio
```






#DEATHSPIRAL 

## Mini-exercise #2

Let's build and combine your new skills in looking up species occurrence data with what we learned about mapping. 

Going back to our peninsula, here are a bunch of species that are endemic to that area.

--->Spergularia melanocaulos
Petrocoptis grandiflora
--->Spergula viscosa
Minuartia cerastiifolia
----->Minuartia recurva
Petrocoptis hispanica
Petrocoptis pyrenaica

Choose any two, and do the following:

#WORK WITH TAXISE
1. Look up - are they accepted names or are they synonyms?

Answer: It looks like they are both accepted names for the species, but are not in ITIS. So, I used Crocus sativus and Daucus carota instead, both of which I know occur on the peninsula because some of my family is from there-- I also grew up seeing these in MA, so I know they're not endemic, but I know they'll be in ITIS. When resolving my new names, both are correct and in use. 


```{r}
library("spocc")
library("taxize")
library("rgbif")

results=gnr_resolve(names="Spergularia melanocaulos")
head(results$matched_name)
results=gnr_resolve(names="Spergula viscosa")
head(results$matched_name)
```

```{r}
#won't work
name="Spergularia melanocaulos"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn
#The output suggests checking the itis database for the accepted name
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```
```{r}
#won't work
name="Spergula viscosa"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn
#The output suggests checking the itis database for the accepted name
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```

```{r}
#replacement
name="Crocus sativus"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn
#The output suggests checking the itis database for the accepted name
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```

```{r}
#replacement
name="Daucus carota"  
tsn=get_tsn(name, accepted=FALSE)
tsn
#The output suggests checking the itis database for the accepted name
lapply(tsn, itis_acceptname)
```


#2. Look up the two plant taxa. Are they both angiosperms? 


Answer: yes, they are both angiosperms; if I didn't know what these plants were, I'd know based on "Spermatophytina" as a subdivision. Also maybe Magnoliopsida?

```{r}
classification(c("Daucus carota", "Crocus sativus"), db="itis")
```


3. Angiosperm or otherwise, what plant family do they belong to?

Answer: The Crocus sativus belongs to the family Iridaceae, and the Daucus carota belongs to the family Apiaceae


4. For at least one genus, look up all the species in that genus.

Below: 

```{r}
downstream("Crocus", downto="species", db="itis")
```

```{r}
downstream("Daucus", downto="species", db="itis")

```

5. For one species, look up to see if there are subspecies or other infraspecific forms.

I guessed at this, but it looks like there are no subspecies classified? I'm not sure how we should know this, as it's not in my notes from class, 

```{r}
downstream("Daucus carota", downto="subspecies", db="itis")
```




#WORK WITH RGBIF OR SPOCC -why is the SPOCC data not showing the correct species??
#FIXED
6. For both, search and download species occurrence data; prepare as a data-frame
7. Clean-up the data-frame:  remove occurrences with missing data and duplicates

```{r}
S_melanocaulos <- occ(q="Spergularia melanocaulos", from="gbif", limit=50)
S_melanocaulos
#By default spocc will return a sample of just 500 observations
#Here, to speed things up during class, I've further limited to just 50 records
#Even though we can see there are 1688 occurrences in the database
#Also, looking in "Environment" in the upper right, we can see that 
#this is not a dataframe. It is a new type of object "Large occdat" which has 10 elements

#We can ask for at data using this format - rename it and look at it (get the heading) 
S_melanocaulos.dat <- (S_melanocaulos$gbif$data)
head(S_melanocaulos.dat)
#But that gives ALL the fields. 
#A nifty function called occ2df gives just some essential data
#It's nifty that the package "spocc" converts this huge result into a slimmed down dataframe (no more extra data in there)
S_melanocaulos.df <- occ2df(S_melanocaulos)
S_melanocaulos.df
#You can see that there are some occurrence records that lack longitude and latitude
#Then you can exclude them
dim(S_melanocaulos.df)
S_melanocaulos.df <- S_melanocaulos.df[complete.cases(S_melanocaulos.df),]
dim(S_melanocaulos.df)
S_melanocaulos.df
```


```{r}
S_viscosa <- occ(q="Spergula viscosa", from="gbif", limit=50)
S_viscosa
S_viscosa.dat <- (S_viscosa$gbif$data)
head(S_viscosa.dat)
#But that gives ALL the fields. 
#A nifty function called occ2df gives just some essential data
#It's nifty that the package "spocc" converts this huge result into a slimmed down dataframe (no more extra data in there)
S_viscosa.df <- occ2df(S_viscosa)
S_viscosa.df
#You can see that there are some occurrence records that lack longitude and latitude
#Then you can exclude them
dim(S_viscosa.df)
S_viscosa.df <- S_viscosa.df[complete.cases(S_viscosa.df),]
dim(S_viscosa.df)
S_viscosa.df

```



#WORK WITH OCCURRENCE DATA, WORLDCLIM DATA AND MAPS - issues with this, need to figure out and fix.

```

```{r}
M_recurva <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Minuartia recurva")

```

```{r}
peninsula.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-10, 4, 35, 45))
plot(peninsula.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], col=cols_t1, pch = 23, cex = 0.6)

```


```{r}
peninsula.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-10, 4, 35, 45))
plot(peninsula.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(S_viscosa[,c("longitude", "latitude")], col="blue", pch = 23, cex = 0.6)
```

```{r}

#extra ? false carrot? 
peninsula.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-10, 4, 35, 45))
plot(peninsula.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(Daucus_carota1[,c("longitude", "latitude")], col="blue", pch = 23, cex = 0.6)
```


9. Also map that species with climate variables on a world map or European map. Are you convinced that the species is endemic to this peninsula?


#? FIX "incorrect number of dimensions??" Didn't work when BIEN data was up top instead of SPOCC either 
```{r}
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 24, cex = 0.5)
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
```


10. Returning to your results for #4 above, find another species with a range outside of the  peninsula. Download occurrence data and map on a world map. 

```{r}
M_recurva <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Minuartia recurva")

```

```{r}
plot(all.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(M_recurva[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 24, cex = 0.5)
plot(all.worldclim[["bio12"]])
points(M_recurva[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
plot(all.worldalt[["alt"]])
points(M_recurva[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
```

11. Then re-map on an appropriately cropped map.
#? need long and lat for this one, as below, though this was just an extra map to make since we really want the climate one
```{r}
map('world', fill=T, col="white", bg="dark blue", xlim=c(-85,-35),ylim=c(-40,12))
points(cbind(S_melanocaulos$longitude, J_pauciflora$latitude), col="red", pch=20, cex=.8)
points(cbind(Daucus_carota1$longitude, J_polita$latitude), col="orange", pch=20, cex=.8)
```


#The map below is not set to coordinates yet, since it's supposed to depend on where we find the species elsewhere in the world
```{r}
newmap.worldclim <- crop(all.worldclim, extent(-#, -#, -#, #))
plot(newmap.worldclim[["bio1"]])
```

#Same as above comment
```{r}
plot(newmap.worldclim[["bio1"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 24, cex = 0.5)
plot(newmap.worldclim[["bio12"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
plot(newmap.worldclim[["alt"]])
points(S_melanocaulos[,c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
```



ONE LAST THING
#12. Don't forget to identify the peninsula that we are working with!

We're working with the Iberian peninsula.
